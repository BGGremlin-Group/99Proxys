## üåü Features

99Proxys v3.5 elevates the proxy experience with advanced features tailored for anonymity, usability, and innovation. Here's what's new and improved:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Global Locale Simulation** | Emulate 99 countries with realistic IPs, timezones, and geolocation data using `timezonefinder` and `pytz`. |
| **SOCKS5 with SSL/TLS** | Secure proxy connections with end-to-end encryption and self-signed certificates. |
| **RSA + Fernet Encryption** | Dual-layer encryption for secure data transmission between nodes. |
| **Dynamic Bandwidth Throttling** | Precise bandwidth control using a token bucket algorithm, configurable per node. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-node request limits to prevent abuse, configurable via `rate_limit`. |
| **Health Monitoring** | Auto-restart failed nodes with real-time health checks and detailed logging. |
| **Rich CLI & GUI** | Sleek CLI with `rich` and a Tkinter GUI with live latency/bandwidth graphs using `matplotlib`. |
| **Real-Time Stats** | Track requests, latency, bandwidth, errors, and connection times in real time. |
| **GeoIP Simulation** | Country-specific IP ranges with virtual IP assignment using `scapy` for authentic proxy chaining. |
| **Exportable Stats** | Save performance data to JSON for analysis and debugging. |
| **WYSIWYG Editor** | Create and edit multi-page websites with a real-time HTML editor powered by Ace. |
| **Real-Time Chatrooms** | Persistent, website-specific chatrooms using `flask_socketio` for user interaction. |
| **Review System** | Submit and view user reviews for websites, secured with CSRF protection via `flask_wtf`. |
| **Testing Framework** | Comprehensive `unittest` suite for nodes, websites, reviews, chat, and bandwidth throttling. |
| **Tor Hidden Services** | Host websites as Tor hidden services with `.onion` addresses for enhanced anonymity. |
| **Input Validation** | Robust validation for all user inputs, including `secure_filename` for Flask routes. |
| **Comprehensive Documentation** | Detailed docstrings and a generated `docs/README.md` for setup and usage. |

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Tor**: Installed and accessible (e.g., `/usr/bin/tor` on Linux)
- **Dependencies**:
  | Package | Version |
  |---------|---------|
  | scapy | >=2.5.0 |
  | rich | >=13.7.1 |
  | plotext | >=5.2.8 |
  | psutil | >=5.9.8 |
  | requests | >=2.31.0 |
  | cryptography | >=42.0.5 |
  | timezonefinder | >=6.1.9 |
  | matplotlib | >=3.8.3 |
  | flask | >=2.3.3 |
  | flask-socketio | >=5.3.6 |
  | flask-sqlalchemy | >=3.0.5 |
  | werkzeug | >=3.0.1 |
  | tkinterweb | >=3.17.3 |
  | flask-wtf | >=1.2.1 |
  | pytz | >=2023.3 |

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository** (Testers Only):
   ```bash
   git clone <private-repo-url>
   cd 99proxys
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: The script auto-installs dependencies on first run.

3. **Install Tor**:
   - Ensure Tor is installed and the executable path is set in `config/99proxys_config.json` (`TOR_PATH`).
   - Example for Linux: `sudo apt-get install tor`.

4. **Generate SSL Certificates**:
   - The app generates self-signed SSL certificates (`server.crt`, `server.key`) in the `certs/` directory on first run.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - **GUI Mode** (default):
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - **CLI Mode**:
     ```bash
     python main.py --cli
     ```

6. **Run Tests** (Optional):
   ```bash
   python -m unittest tests/test_proxy.py
   ```

*Note*: Virtual IP assignment requires root privileges. Run with `sudo` or configure `setcap` for network capabilities.

## üß† Architecture

99Proxys v3.5 is designed for modularity, security, and scalability. Here's how it works:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|SOCKS5| B[Entry Node]
    B -->|Encrypted Tunnel| C[Node 2]
    C -->|Encrypted Tunnel| D[Node N]
    D -->|HTTPS| E[External Server]
    B --> F[Health Monitor]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    F --> G[Stats & Logs]
    G --> H[GUI/CLI]
    D --> I[Flask Web Server]
    I --> J[Tor Hidden Service]
    I --> K[WYSIWYG Editor]
    I --> L[Chatroom]
    I --> M[Review System]
    J --> N[.onion Website]
```

- **ProxyNode**: Handles SOCKS5 connections with SSL/TLS, RSA, and Fernet encryption, plus virtual IP/MAC assignment via `scapy`.
- **ProxyChain**: Manages node lifecycle, IP/MAC rotation, Tor hidden services, and website creation.
- **GUI/CLI**: Provides user interfaces for control, monitoring, and website management.
- **Flask Web Server**: Hosts websites, chatrooms, reviews, and the WYSIWYG editor with `flask_socketio` and `flask_sqlalchemy`.
- **Health Monitor**: Ensures node reliability with auto-restarts and detailed logging.
- **Database**: Stores website metadata, pages, reviews, and chat messages using SQLite.
