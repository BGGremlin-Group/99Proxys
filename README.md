## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Dependencies**:
  | Package | Version |
  |---------|---------|
  | scapy | >=2.5.0 |
  | rich | >=13.7.1 |
  | plotext | >=5.2.8 |
  | psutil | >=5.9.8 |
  | requests | >=2.31.0 |
  | cryptography | >=42.0.5 |
  | timezonefinder | >=6.1.9 |
  | matplotlib | >=3.8.3 |

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository** (Testers Only):
   ```bash
   git clone <private-repo-url>
   cd 99proxys
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note*: The script auto-installs dependencies on first run.

3. **Generate SSL Certificates**:
   - The app generates self-signed SSL certificates (`server.crt`, `server.key`) in the `certs/` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - **GUI Mode** (default):
     ```bash
     python 99proxys.py
     ```
   - **CLI Mode**:
     ```bash
     python 99proxys.py --cli
     ```

## üöÄ Usage

### CLI Interface
Launch the CLI for a classic experience:
```bash
python 99proxys.py --cli
```

**Menu Options**:
| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | Setup Nodes |
| 2 | Roll All Nodes |
| 3 | Roll Single Node |
| 4 | Stop Single Node |
| 5 | Show Stats |
| 6 | Plot Stats |
| 7 | Stop All Nodes |
| 8 | Run Setup Wizard |
| 9 | Export Stats |
| 0 | Exit |

**Example**:
```bash
$ python 99proxys.py --cli
üî• 99Proxys - Private Local VPN Network üî•
1. Setup Nodes
2. Roll All Nodes
...
Enter choice: 1
[green]Successfully set up 5 nodes[/green]
```

### GUI Interface
Launch the GUI for a sleek, visual experience:
```bash
python 99proxys.py
```

**GUI Features**:
- Real-time node status table
- Live latency and bandwidth graphs
- Individual node controls (roll/stop)
- Setup wizard for configuration
- Export stats to JSON

### Configuration
Edit `config/99proxys_config.json` or use the Setup Wizard:
```json
{
  "node_count": 5,
  "ip_range": "192.168.0.0/16",
  "locales": ["USA", "Japan", "Germany", "Brazil", "Australia"],
  "min_port": 1024,
  "max_port": 65535,
  "min_speed_kbps": 56,
  "max_bandwidth_kbps": 1000,
  "rate_limit": 100
}
```

## üß† Architecture

99Proxys v2.0 is built for modularity and performance. Here's how it works:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] -->|SOCKS5| B[Entry Node]
    B -->|Encrypted Tunnel| C[Node 2]
    C -->|Encrypted Tunnel| D[Node N]
    D -->|HTTPS| E[External Server]
    B --> F[Health Monitor]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    F --> G[Stats & Logs]
    G --> H[GUI/CLI]
```

- **ProxyNode**: Handles SOCKS5 connections with SSL/TLS, RSA, and Fernet encryption.
- **ProxyChain**: Manages node lifecycle, IP/MAC rotation, and configuration.
- **GUI/CLI**: Provides user interfaces for control and monitoring.
- **Health Monitor**: Ensures node reliability with auto-restarts.
